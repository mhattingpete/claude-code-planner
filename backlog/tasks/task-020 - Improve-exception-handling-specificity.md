## Description

Some exception handlers use broad 'except Exception' clauses instead of specific exception types, reducing debugging effectiveness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Specific exception types are used where possible
- [ ] Exception handling is more targeted
- [ ] Debugging information is preserved and useful
